# Supervised Learning
Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning that maps an input to an output. What it does is that it takes training data with features and targets and tries to match the features to the respective targets. It will then use these same methods to take unknown attributes and match it to its respective target.

### Training and Testing Data
In order to perform supervised machine learning, we will often split our data into training and testing data using Scikit-Learn's train test split function. What Scikit-Learn does is it randomly splits the data into a set percentage of training and testing data. This way, after we train our data, we can see test it to see if our model was accurate or not.

### Classification and Regression
Supervised Machine Learning is good for both classification and regression. For the subsequent modules, we will mainly be performing classification (where we try to sort data into various classes), but we will also perform regression. 

### Here are the modules that utilize supervised machine learning:
