# INDE-577 Data Science and Machine Learning
Welcome to the INDE-577 Github Repository of Sarah Wang. This Github Repository derives itself from the various lessons learned in Randy Davila's INDE-577 Data Science and Machine Learning Class. 

For all of my code, I will be using data derived from two datasets derived here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
There are two similar datasets contained in this link. One is a comparison of the different kinds of red wine while the other is a comparison of the quality of different kinds of white wine. In this Github repository, I will analyze the components that make up a good wine.

### Tasks
Add load_wine dataset to description
Talk about skicit-learn as well as error measurements
