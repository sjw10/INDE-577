# INDE-577 Data Science and Machine Learning
Welcome to the INDE-577 Github Repository of Sarah Wang, a current freshman at Rice University. This Github Repository derives itself from the various lessons learned in Randy Davila's INDE-577 Data Science and Machine Learning Class.

## Datasets
Most of my code will come from three different datasets. 
The first data set comes from Scikit-Learn's load wine dataset. This dataset categorizes three different classes of wine using various different attributes such as magnesium levels and color intensity. I will use to mainly to perform classification for these classes of wine


The other two main datasets I will be using come from this site here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
There are two similar datasets contained in this link. One is a comparison of the different kinds of red wine while the other is a comparison of the quality of different kinds of white wine. In this Github repository, I will analyze the components that make up a good wine.

In general, almost all of this repository is centered on wine analysis, and is an in-depth study of various attributes of wine, as well as which features are most important in making a high-quality wine. 

### Tasks
Add load_wine dataset to description
Talk about skicit-learn as well as error measurements
