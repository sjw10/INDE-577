# Decision Trees
Decision Trees are another example of non-parametric models used for classification and regression.

### Real World Example
The idea behind the decision tree is relatively intuitive. We probably have all seen the questionaires that ask us a series of yes or no questions to determine the best possible choice for us. A simple example is like those worksheets you probably filled out in elementary school in order to determine the right animal. The questions might go something like this:

Say your animal is a cat.

- Does your animal breathe air?
- No (if yes, it is a type of fish)
- Can it fly?
- No (if yes, start asking about birds)
- Does it have fur?
- Yes.
- Is it commonly kept as a pet?
- Yes.
- Is it usually kept in a cage?

... and so on until you reach the conclusion that it is a cat. 

In fact, this is similar to the game 20 questions where you try to guess an object in under a series of 20 questions. As we can see, the questions get narrower and narrower with each subsequent question.
